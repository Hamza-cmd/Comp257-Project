#Analysing the trend in real estate vs census given demographic elements

Current real estate market is very volatile and unpredictable. Many econonic theories failed to analyse and predict the future during this period. Because of this many people lost confidence in property investment and many have strong belief on this property boom. There has been lots of factors to consider in real estate industry which may or may not be direclty related to Australian Demography and economy but we will try to analyse national level element such as age, location, income to consider and also try to analyse and predict rental and sales residence categorically such as house, appartment or even townhouses.

#Goal of our project:
- To analyse and predict whether age, income and location are the key demographic component in housing market or interest rates, immigration and too much access to resource and information plays role in these trends.

- The outcome may help in better decision making about the residential options of individuals.

#Data Source

The dataset are extracted from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). We will include data from different geographic and demographic locations to see variation in analysis.

The data is mainly for the time when the Australian real estate was in one of the highest point in terms of transactions.  This project tries to analyse the data of people living in their own property and people renting. Furthermore, it will try to find common and opposing elements in affecting related trends. We will further analyse if factors like interest rate or type of residence plays role in people favoring one way of residence than other.


#Format of data
The data is in xlsx files, which we might have to modify the format to have uniform data format.  

#Preparing Data
##Data Cleaning
###Missing values: 
There are lots of missing values in the given datasets. Example being, some Local Government Areas are with value Total, and fields like First Quartile Weekly Rent for New Bonds are without values. Some fields are with default answer of Total instead of logical values.



##Data Manipulation
###Calculating differences: 
We need to analyse mainly the overall data of rent and sales, also the trend for either buy or rent by different property type. Main analysis factors includes:
- Behaviours towards owning the property vs renting
- Demographic factors in property decision making
- Change in behaviour in terms of property tys

##Techniques expected to use in the project
We are aiming on applying some statistical analysis technique such as finding and grouping data and experimenting linear regression analysis. We might plot data to visualise our outcome and also provide some descriptive analysis.

##A project plan
- Week 10 Initial data manipulation by cleaning of data and manipulation
- Week 11 Use of appropriate algorithm for model building
- Week 12 Testing and evaluating model for final project presentation
